# eth-movie-ratings

Goal: 
- To gain an understanding and command of essential tools (Truffle, Web3, and testrpc) required in crafting and deploying smart contracts to the Ethereum blockchain 
- Create a UI that imports such contracts and interacts with them via the Web3 JavaScript API

Quick start:

Make sure you have Truffle and TestRPC installed:

`npm install -g truffle ethereumjs-testrpc`

Then follow the rest of these steps:


```
git clone git@github.com:bloom510/eth-movie-ratings.git
cd app-ui
npm install

Start TestRPC in a separate command-line window by running: 
testrpc

Start the front-end. Back in /app-ui, run:
npm start

```

You can click on movie titles to vote, and view transactions in the command-line running testrpc.
